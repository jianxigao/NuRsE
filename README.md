About simulation code : NuRsEv1.0 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The folder Simulation_real ----> provides simulation code to study the 
                  resilience on real networks, in this folder there are 
                  three folders corresponding to three dynamics studied 
                  in our paper.

The folder Simulation_synthetic ----> provides simulation code to study 
                  the resilience on synthetic networks.
